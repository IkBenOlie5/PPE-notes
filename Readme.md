I am studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics and Merton College, Oxford. This is my obsidian vault with all my lecture notes, problem sheet solutions and physical notes.

For graphs I used [obsidian-desmos](https://github.com/Nigecat/obsidian-desmos), so the graphs will look like code blocks on GitHub.
