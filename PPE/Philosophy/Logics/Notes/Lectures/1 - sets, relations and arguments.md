sentences that are true or false are declarative sentences

an argument consists of a set of declarative sentences (premisses) and a conclusion

conclusion is not necessarily at the end of an argument:

I'm not dreaming. for, if i can see the computer in front of me, I'm not dreaming; and I can see the computer in front of me.

  

There are patterns in arguments. A if B. B. Therefore A.

An argument is logically (or formally) valid if and only if there is no interpretation under which the premisses are all true and the conclusion is false.

A is B. All B are C. Therefore A is C.

The argument does not have to be true for it to be valid:

Volker is a logician. all logician have suvs. therefore volker has a suv.

Not every true argument is valid:

Volker is a logician. some logician are german. therefore volker is german.

If you reinterpret voker as james: James studd is a logician. The argument is no longer true.

only the subject-specific vocabulary can be re-interpreted, not the logical vocabulary such as 'as', 'some', 'all'

The truth of the conclusion follows from the truth of the premisses independantly of what the subject-specific expressions mean.

the truth of the conclusion follows from the truth of the premisses purely in virtue of the form of the argument

it is not possible that the premisses of all logically valid argument are true and its conclusion is false

  

Some arguments have assumptions which no longer make them logically valid:

every eu citizen van enter the us without a visa. max is a citizen of sweden. therefore max can enter the us without a visa.

there is an implicit assumption that every citizen of sweden is a eu citizen. by adding that premiss the argument becomes valid.

  

A set of sentences is consistent if and only if there is at least one interpretation user which all sentences of the set are true.

A sentence is logically ture if and only if it is true under all interpretations:

all metaphycisians are metaphysysians

and logically false is the opposite:

all metaphycisians are not metaphysisians

  

A set is a collection of objects.

the objects in the set are the elements of the set

There is a difference between the set with a single element and that single element

sets are identical if and only if they have the same elements:

the set aof all animals with kidneys = the set of all animals with a heart

ø = the set with no elements, there is only one of these

A set is denoted with {} by listing them in them

or: {d: d is an animal with a heart} contains all animals with a heart

There is no order in sets, they are identical if they contain the same elements. If you write the same object multiple times in a set the set does not grow

∈ = contains

ø contains {ø}

an ordered pair = tuple

iff = if and only if

a set is a binary relation iff it only contains onrdered pairs

ø is a binary relation

the relation of _being a bigger country than_ _is the set {\france, italy/, \italy, austria/, ...}_

they can be visualised by diagrams with arrows

a binary relation is symmetric iff for every arrow there is also an arrow back

a binary relation is transitive iff you whenever can get from another point in multiple steps to another steps there is also always a direct arrow

a binary relation is reflexive on another set if every element also has an arrow to themselves

a binary relatio is a function iff
