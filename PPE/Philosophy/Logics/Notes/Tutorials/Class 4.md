YOU SHOULD UNDERATAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN $\exists x (Ax \land Bx)$ and $\exists x (Ax \rightarrow Bx)$, and $\forall x (Ax \rightarrow Bx)$ and $\forall x (Ax \land Bx)$.

"In TLM it says "the upper index is called the predicate letter's 'arity-index' [...] The number of strings of dots must always correspond the the arity-index of the predicate letter." (p. 76-77)
Then what arity-index would this get (two strings of dots but only one predicate needed):
$P^?$: $..._1$ loves $..._1$ (themselves)

Why can only P, Q and R be predicate letters? page 82
why only a, b, c constants
and only xyz variables

p. 91: why can't "... has a computer" not just be a predicate, why does it have to be "... has ..."
