YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN $\exists x (Ax \land Bx)$ and $\exists x (Ax \rightarrow Bx)$, and $\forall x (Ax \rightarrow Bx)$ and $\forall x (Ax \land Bx)$.

"In TLM it says "the upper index is called the predicate letter's 'arity-index' [...] The number of strings of dots must always correspond the the arity-index of the predicate letter." (p. 76-77)
Then what arity-index would this get (two strings of dots but only one predicate needed):
$P^?$: $..._1$ loves $..._1$ (themselves)

Why can only P, Q and R be predicate letters? page 82
why only a, b, c constants
and only xyz variables

p. 91: why can't "... has a computer" not just be a predicate, why does it have to be "... has ..."
... and why is it different for 'is' p. 78, 
**Because for "is ..."  the "..." is usually a bijvoegelijk naamwoord, so then there is no way to fill it. It makes sense for "is a scrooge".**
"... has ..." usually is an existential claim: "for all x (if x is a person, then for at least one y (y is a soul and x has y))"


in TLM there is no mention of a domain, does that mean that the domain is just always "everything"

"In the definition of formulae (Def'n. 4.7), TLM does not include forallx's restriction (on p. 83) on the formulae to which quantifiers can be prepended to produce other formulae. However, a restriction like that is ultimately needed (implicitly) for TLM's definition of an _L_2-sentence (Def'n. 4.10). I will discuss what I take to be a more elegant version of this restriction in class." what do you mean?
