$\exists x Px = Pa \lor Pb \lor Pc \lor Pa_1 \lor Pb_1 \lor Pc_1 ...$
$\forall x Px = Pa \land Pb \land Pc \land Pa_1 \land Pb_1 \land Pc_1 ...$
They are exactly (logically) the same, therefore, you can prove all the $\exists$- and $\forall$-introduction and -elimination rules with the $\land$- and $\lor$-rules (T)
