Dear Sam,

  

I had a thought about quantifiers and I wanted to confirm whether it is correct. Is it true that the exists quantifier is just an infinite string of 'or’-statements appended together, and the universal quantifier an infinite string of ‘and’-statements. So you would then get:

∃xPx = Pa ∨ Pb ∨ Pc ∨ Pa ∨Pb ∨Pc ... 

∀xPx = Pa ∧ Pb ∧ Pc ∧ Pa ∧Pb ∧Pc …

where the constants would take up every possible value in the domain. And that you could then prove all the ∃- and ∀-introduction and -elimination rules with the ∧- and ∨-rules (because they are essentially the same rules):

- So for the ∀-Intro rule one could prove it by saying that it is exactly the same as the ∧-Intro rule (where you can put things together if you have proven them individually) and the restrictions on the arbitrary variable make sure that the proof would be valid for every single atomic sentence in the infinite string of ∧-statements.

- And the ∀-Elim rule with the ∧-Elim rule because the ∧-Elim would say you could get any single one of the constituent atomic sentences in the endless string of ∧-statements.

- The ∃-Intro rule would be the same as the the ∨-Intro rule, because you could add an endless amount of ‘or’s when you have a single one.

- And finally the  ∃-Elim rule with the ∨-Elim rule because the restrictions on the arbitrary variable make sure that the proof would be valid for every single constituent atomic sentence in the infinite string of ∨-statements.

  

It seems like the quantifier-rules are exactly the same as the or- and and-rules. Is it correct to think of the quantifiers this way or am I not seeing something?

  

Kind regards,

Olivier
