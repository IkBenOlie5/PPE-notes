Why can it also be satisfied by **SOME** variable assignment (p. 105)?

Why can't the domain be the empty set?

"In the definition of formulae (Def'n. 4.7), TLM does not include forallx's restriction (on p. 83) on the formulae to which quantifiers can be prepended to produce other formulae. However, a restriction like that is ultimately needed (implicitly) for TLM's definition of an _L_2-sentence (Def'n. 4.10). I will discuss what I take to be a more elegant version of this restriction in class.”

  

I was wondering why it is ultimately needed. Forallx talks about a variable not serving multiple masters, but can I not just do:

Domain: {0}

G: {⟨0, 0⟩}

And then say:

∀x∃xGxx

This was also the example that Ronya gave to show that it was possible. So what exactly is the problem in this sentence?

**Volker even gave an example in the lecture in 6.2 where he allowed this**

For 5.1, whenever you need multiple variables you say: for 9 for instance:
let alpha be a variable assignment for x = ..., then there is no variable assignment beta, differing from alpha in y at most, so that it is part of the set (for saying it is part of the set use variable assignment beta). and for 10, if x = 2 you can switch back to the original variable assignment again:
