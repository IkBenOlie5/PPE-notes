Statements are (parts of) sentences that can be determinately true or false.

Exposition vs. argument.

An argument that contains implicit statements is an enthymeme.

Principle of charity: give the author the benefit of the doubt by adding logical assumptions or conclusions.

A proposition is the content or meaning expressed by a statement.

  

vagueness, (they're not short, but they're not not short), they are not really determinately true/false.

logical truth/contradiction/contingency

truth-value-preservation

inductively valid arguments

soundness = validity + truth of premises

any argument whose conclusion is a logical truth is valid. (valid is whenever premises are true then conclusion is true)

any argument with a contradiction as a premise is valid. (valid is whenever all premises are false then conclusion cannot be true)
