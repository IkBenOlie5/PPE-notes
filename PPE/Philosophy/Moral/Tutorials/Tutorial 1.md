With Mill's idea of competent judges, is it even hedonism anymore, or has it become more of a emotivist moral philosophy when everything is based of "observation and experience", is not everything just based of intuition then? Could you not argue that Mill just pretty much gets rid of hedonism, because it is now just hedonism that like fits around an emotivist philosophy?
