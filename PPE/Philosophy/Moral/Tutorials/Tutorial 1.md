Feedback: [[Does Mill’s distinction between higher and lower pleasures provide a successful defence of Hedonism?.pdf]]

**Is all physical pain of the same quality???** (perhaps the needle is not  )



With Mill's idea of competent judges, is it even hedonism anymore, or has it become more of a intuitionist moral philosophy when everything is based of "observation and experience", is not everything just based of intuition then? Could you not argue that Mill just pretty much gets rid of hedonism, because it is now just hedonism that like fits around an emotivist philosophy?

QUESTION ABOUT Anderson page 13

Hi both, 
  

Thanks for a good discussion yesterday. I just spotted an error on one of my comments to you Olivier, and wanted to clarify to you both. The Swine Objection and the Oyster objection are **both** against the view _all_ pleasures are equally intrinsically valuable (including base pleasures). The Experience Machine objection is against the view that _only_ pleasures are intrinsically valuable/contribute to our well-being. Hope this helps. 

  

All the best, 

Ellie

Hi Ellie,

  

Does that then mean that it is okay to use them somewhat interchangeably (as the oyster objection is just a thought experiment showcasing the swine objection)? Or should I still be careful?

  

Kind regards,

Olivier

Hi Olivier, 

  

Good question - basically yes. The Oyster objection is Roger Crisps version of the Swine Objection. It develops the Swine case by asking us to think about the value of _variety_ in our experiences.  Crisp's oyster, like Mill's satisfied swine, gets only lower pleasure, but the oyster's life has an additional unappealing feature that Mill's pig avoids: _lack of variety_.  Crisp's reply to _Haydn and the Oyster_ is that no matter how long the angel makes the oyster life, Haydn's life can nevertheless contain more enjoyment.

  

Does that make sense? 

  

All the best, 

Ellie
