Crisp p. 147:
"It is important to note in passing that the cases of George and Jim both involve the agent’s being required to act in a certain way by utilitarianism because of circumstances importantly shaped by other people’s projects, projects of which George and Jim, and indeed most of us, disapprove"
The same is true for effective altruism, people disapprove of how unequal the world is, and we are being required to act in a certain way because how the world is shaped by other people, projects that we disapprove of.


Natalism makes all of this even worse, pascal's mugging kan dit niet oplossen

explain that utilitarianism can be too demanding therefore integrity objection

One can defend this, however, by saying that utilitarians should just bite the bullet and accept that we will have to give up our own happiness (because of circumstances shaped by other crisp p. 147), in order to improve the world (perhaps not even sacrifice happiness because people can get a lot of pleasure from it), so that, when the world is much more utilitarian, we have the freedom to care for friends because that is where the most pleasure will then come from (Crisp somewhere). An example of this would be the EA movement. Perhaps explain singers drowning example (or perhaps in the thing above)

However, a lot of ea thinkers (nick bostrtom), also emphasize future generations, longtermism, very much (in the utilitarian framework). However, there is a problem (turning on the light will in the very long term probably kill someone). And not many people would be willing to bite the bullet here (as this is forever, always, for the rest for the history of humanity, should people sacrifice their own happiness for the happiness in the future), one could no longer have friends etc. because they should spend all their time helping people.

With AI or something explain pascals mugging perhaps, and then explain that this very small chance does not work, however there still is a problem when you think about things which will most definitely go bad

however, Mill could counter this will multi-level utilitarianism. And perhaps this would tell you to choose a middenweg between de uitersten (care about climate while simultaneously caring about friends and personal connection etc.).
