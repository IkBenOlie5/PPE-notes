Can't happiness also be a desire we have because of associationism. People who are more happy are more likely to survive, therefore we desire happiness. The ultimate goal would then be survival, fitness (Darwinism). (Crisp p. 85)

The visible analogy is not a good analogy. Rather it should be that Mill cannot prove that it is worthwhile to look at for instance paintings, is that people look at paintings. Just like with desirable not only means that people *can* desire it, but means that it is worthwhile to desire it.
This, however, might have made things more complicated because one could argue that according to Mill, the reason that people think it is worthwhile to look at paintings, is because they get pleasure from it, they desire it. So then he would be saying the same thing twice.
