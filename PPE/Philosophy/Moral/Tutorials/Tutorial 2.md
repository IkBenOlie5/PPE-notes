The visible analogy is not a good analogy. Rather it should be that Mill cannot prove that it is worthwhile to look at for instance paintings, is that people look at paintings. Just like with desirable not only means that people *can* desire it, but means that it is worthwhile to desire it.
This, however, might have made things more complicated because one could argue that according to Mill, the reason that people think it is worthwhile to look at paintings, is because they get pleasure from it, they desire it. So then he would be saying the same thing twice.


**Plan for essay:**

Moore and his objection, rebuttel (p. 200 Warnock)

Explain why it makes sense from a darwinistic pov, happiness is a tool for fitness

back this up, we get happiness from sex, from not being alone (no loneliness), because they increase our fitness/offspring.



Can't happiness also be a desire we have because of associationism. People who are more happy are more likely to survive, therefore we desire happiness. The ultimate goal would then be survival, fitness (Darwinism). (Crisp p. 85)

Finally, Mill and Darwin would disagree on whether it would be innate or not. (p. 91)

conclusion
counterargument that perhaps that means that not the ultimate goal is happiness, but fitness (perhaps there is no ultimate goal) (perhaps this as last sentence of conclusion)
Perhaps we can conclude that there is not really an ultimate goal. However, this does not practically change anything, because precisely the fact that we have evolved to feel pleasure and happiness, means that humans enjoy it very much. And that, in of itself, should be the reason that we have to promote it. Because every other thing we desire comes from this pleasure.

*"With this, it seems like Mill is trying to get at exactly the same as I was in the beginning of this essay. That people desire things because they increase their fitness, and humans have evolved this capability of feeling pleasure to incentivise us to do those things. And as a result, things that are good for us and our fitness go hand in hand with pleasure, they are inextricably linked. And so, we associate pleasure with those things."*

I guess one obvious counterargument could be that we sometimes desire some things that are not good for us (eg macdonalds), precisely because the modern day world is not build for cavemen humans (which we ultimately are, we want to consume as many calories as possible). And so, not necessarily every thing we desire should be desirable... as going to macdonalds every day would negatively impact our health and we can agree that that is probably not desirable.
Perhaps, a refutation to this would be that humans are just very bad a choosing from short term versus long term. If one had the choice between good health or bad health with macdonalds right b
