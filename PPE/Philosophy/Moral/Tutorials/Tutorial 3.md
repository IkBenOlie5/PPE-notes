Why can't we derive rules from tendencies? Crisp p. 108 & p. 104

[[How is Mill’s ‘proof’ of Utilitarianism supposed to work? Does it succeed?.pdf]]
Retrospectively: **Mill seems to fully agree with my argument. See Crisp p. 108**
Is this true? He says exactly that we have gotten our customary morality already (although he doesn't say from evolution), and that utilitarianism is only signposts.
To refute a counterargument here, why do some people have the wrong morality, because in the past it gave the most happiness, right now though it no longer and therefore we should try to change our associations through education. (See Crisp p. 112)

I think Mill is a rule-utilitarian (Crisp p.112)
