Why can't we derive rules from tendencies? Crisp p. 108 & p. 104

[[How is Mill’s ‘proof’ of Utilitarianism supposed to work? Does it succeed?.pdf]]
Retrospectively: **Mill seems to fully agree with my argument. See Crisp p. 108**
Is this true? He says exactly that we have gotten our customary morality already (although he doesn't say from evolution), and that utilitarianism is only signposts.
To refute a counterargument here, why do some people have the wrong morality, because in the past it gave the most happiness, right now though it no longer and therefore we should try to change our associations through education. (See Crisp p. 112)

I think Mill is a rule-utilitarian (Crisp p.112)
*"Perhaps the most common confusion, and one still found in much contemporary writing in ethics, is between a version of multi-level act utilitarianism, such as Mill’s, which advocates adherence to ordinary moral rules, and rule utilitarianism."* p.113
Explain!!!!

Defend mill from the unconscious rape scenario: Crisp p.117
And with the sheriff objection p.118

**Essay plan:**

Start with unconscious rape scenario. More interesting than the sheriff objection. A single-level act-utilitarian would allow it, however, as mill places emphasis on the long term, if people get used to raping women, than women would no longer feel safe etc. etc. ...

Use the above to conclude that Mill is not a rule utilitarian, nor a single-level act utilitarian.

Explain that according to his theory, incest would be allowed. explain why it does not have the same problems as the unconscious rape scenario.

Refute about misformed children counterargument. can be refuted two ways, people who have huntington disease/down syndrome should no longer be allowed to have kids. Why not just use a condom/sterilization (as is allowed in many states in the US). Explain that the problem with this objection is that it is just a practical objection, there is nothing intrinsi

Perhaps we should normalise incest
