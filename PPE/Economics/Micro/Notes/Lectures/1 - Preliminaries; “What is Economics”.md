Economics examines how scarce resources are allocated and the mechanisms that facilitate this distribution.

- markets are a mechanism for this allocation
- governments
- crime, charities, lotteries, cooperations/clubs

  

And the way that the outcome of this allocation is affected by the environments in which the economic agents act:

- uncertainty
- asymmetric information/knowledge
- asymmetric bargaining power
- externalities/spillovers/feedback

  

normative and positive analysis:

- is-ought fallacy
- positive analyses is the attempt to understand the world around us
- normative analysis involves the attempt to determine what is the best course of action
- policy analysis uses both
- pareto improvesments are policies that benefit everyone, uncontroversial
- usually there are winners and losers from a policy, more controversial
- cost benefit analysis, weigh the cost against the benefits by monetizing them (financially valuing something)
- A local property tax to fund a new sports centre:
- people without properties will benefit from the sports centre
- people with properties are disproportionatly affected, because they are the ones who pay for the sports centre
- welfare analysis, social preferences
- property tax for opera:
- bulk of property taxes are paid by lower and middle income people, although most of the opera-goers are rich
- opportunity cost, there are not just the explicit costs of something, but there are also the costs that arise from the fact that there might be another, better choice:
- university education:
- not only the cost of the fees and equipment etc
- also the value of the salary that would have been earned during the time at university but was not
- economics are complex systems
- therefore it is helpful to divide effects into piec
- one assumption is that humans are a homo economicus, there is a very strong instrumentalis flavour to economics, as long as the model works, it is ok
- behavioural economics emplys a more complete and plausible definition
- choice-revealed preference, refusing to take an a priori view of what motivates people
- reverse engineering
- to build an effective model we need we need to distinguish between:
- the essential featusers of the economy that are relevant to the question we want to answer, which should be included in the model
- unimportant details that can be omitted
