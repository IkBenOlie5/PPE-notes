whether a model for behaviour (homo economicus) is correct can be tested empirically, it can be quantitavely falsified

ideas are usually expressed mathematically:

- Removes ambiguity/more precise
- needs simplification
- introduces rigor at the cost of over-simplification
  

It is a set of methods

capitalism led to growth:

1. impact on technology, firms start to adopt and develop new technologies, because the countries were very balanced, there was an incentive to become stronger than the other which lead to innovation. In contrast: china was very big and therefore had no competition
2. specialization: bigger firms allows for specialization which makes everything go faster. increases productivity
3. learning by doing
4. taking advantage of natural differences in skill
5. economies of scale, the more you make the better and efficienter you can do it
6. (pin factory, adam smith)
7. this is only possible of the specialized people can buy the other things they need, so markets are required for specialization
8. absolute advantage vs comparative advantage:
9. absolute advantage = specializing allows for more producing _using the same amount of resources (smith)_
10. comparative advantage = even if one country are bad at creating everything, they should still create those things. the productivity of labour (the quantity of produced output per worker) varies between industries. But if one country had an absolute advantage in both goods, on smiths intuition trade wuuld not be advantageous. terms of trade ("relative price"). production possibility frontier, if you produce more of one thing you have to produce less of another thing. guns v butter, compare the opportunity costs.
11. the boundary of the frontier is called the production possibility frontier (PPF)
14. typically the MRT gets steeper, diminishim marginal return it is very easy to start making a little bit of butter if you are only creating guns
15. heterogenity
16. sometimes the ppf is a straight line, in this case it is more efficient to let the micro tutor do just micro tutes, and the macro tutor do macro tutes. than the total number of micro and macro tutes is the largest (=comparative advantage). if they both do the same micro as macro tutes there will only be 80 of both instead of 120 of both. by both specializing it is the most efficient, there is an absolute advantage
17. now if one has an advantage on one of the things and is as good on the other thing. they can still benefit from trade, the worse one has a comparative advantage because he gives up only one micro for every macro he does, whereas the other one must give up two.
18. gains from trade exist with heterogeneity in production opportunity cost.
19. these arise from differences in factor of production:
20. some are fixed (naturaal resources)
21. some are mobile (financial capital)
22. and some intermediate (labour in countries which don't allow immigration it is fixed and vice versa)
23. comparative advantage can also arise from a legal system which enforces property rights and contracts
24. this implies that countries should take advantage of there natural resources/large land masses/highly skillded work force
25. also that there should be more trade between underdeveloped nations and underdeveloped (intrer-industry trade) nations then developed nations with developed nations.
26. this is not the case (intra-industry trade)
27. productive heterogeneity is only an incentive to trade, people also have to notice. in international trade, politics plays a big role
