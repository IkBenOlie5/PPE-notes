$$\frac{\Delta p_D}{\Delta p_S} = \frac{|\epsilon_S|}{|\epsilon_D|}$$
So this is the effective incidence, apparently has something to do with the explanation on Perloff page 69

$$\epsilon = \frac{dQ}{dp} \frac{p}{q} = \frac{d\ln(Q)}{d \ln(p)}$$
They are the same, so you can use a trick to get the elasticity for a curve.
Say you have the curve $q = 10 - p$ if you then log both sides ... something
