a. 
A: $y = 125 - \frac{1}{2}x$
B: $y = 300 - 2x$
```desmos-graph
left = 0; right = 400;
bottom = 0; top = 400;
---
y = 125 - \frac{1}{2}x
y = 300 - 2x
```


b. Country B has an absolute advantage on good 2. County A has a comparative advantage on good 1, because of the opportunity costs involved if B started producing good 1.
c.
```desmos-graph
left = 0; right = 500;
bottom = 0; top = 500;
---
y = 425 - \frac{1}{2}x | x < 250
y = 300 - 2(x-250) | x > 250

| production good 1  | 250 | 0   |
| production good 2  | 0   | 300 |
| consumption good 1 | 150 | 100 |
| consumption good 2 | 180 | 120 |

| export good 2      | 0   | 180 |

e. 
Yes, they are now able to consume more than they used to, and they profit from exporting.

c.
Down, currently every good is more expensive in country B, and country B has neither an absolute nor a comparative advantage.

d.
highest: £6
lowest: £2

e.
For rubber chickens (lowest) and beauty products (highest) you can predict it with certainty (because it is assumed that trade happens). 
For trousers and poison gas you need to know the price of labour.

| A       | B        |

| T - £8  | PG - £12 |

For every item, the workers can buy more or the same amount of that item that before trade, so they have gained from trade.

h.
- Countries benefit from trade and specialisation.
- Lowering wages does not necessarily mean that workers can buy less, their money might become worth more in terms of the goods that they can buy.
